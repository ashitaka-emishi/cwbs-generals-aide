This time, Jackson would follow the last Union forces across White Oak, while Longstreet, Magruder, and Huger swung south and west. The roads heading southeast from Richmond spread out in a fan pattern, providing perfect approaches for Lee's intended plan. Huger was to move down the Charles City Road,, Longstreet down the Darbytown Road, and Magruder to come in behind Longstreet for support. Holmes, meanwhile, was to move via the New Market and River Roads to threaten the Malvern Hill area, where it appeared McClellan was heading.",

In fact, Jackson's four divisions and Huger's did little more all day than lob a few cannon shells at the Federals, leaving Hill and Longstreet to carry the fight alone. The result was bloody but indecisive. Longstreet's combined force made headway, but Federal reinforcements amounting to half of the force opposing Jackson stabilized the tactical situation by nightfall, and The Union army slipped away again. This was perhaps Jackson's worst day in command",

His intention was to subdue the Federal line with a powerful artillery bombardment before launching the infantry attacks, but the Federal Reserve artillery was so powerful and effective that the Rebels never really got any effective fire in at all. What was left was a pure infantry attack into the teeth of well sited Federal infantry and artillery. DH Hill put it best when he called it murder, not war",

Those of you with all nine maps at this point might want to lay them all out a minute just to reflect on the amount of ground McClellan had covered, to end up huddled beside the James on this last little corner of the map. Unquestionably, the Union army was running. However, it far from defeated. Malvern Hill was a compact position, well supported with artillery, and secure on both flanks. Moreover, virtually the entire army was united again, with only one division of 4th Corps off-map at Harrison's Landing. Any Rebel attack on the Federals here would face significant obstacles. I have given the Federals McClellan again, even though historically he left the field by 9:45 that morning to visit Harrison's Landing. I have found that stripping the Union of any commander at all allows his opponent to artificially manipulate that situation. I doubt McClellan's presence or absence will make that significant an impact, however, given the situation as it is—the armies are done maneuvering, with no maps left to run to.",

McClellan was finishing the move to Harrison’s Landing, and the Federal troops were heading to Malvern Hill, where they could cover the last stages of the Union retreat. This scenario does contain one anomaly; McClellan is present throughout. Historically, he was absent for both Glendale and Malvern Hill, which is why the scenarios covering those specific actions leave the Union bereft of an army commander. To fully represent McClellan's actions in this two day scenario, however, would require a large number of rules for entering and leaving the maps, and have the net effect of making the game completely miserable for the Federals. For a quick method of recreating McClellan's prolonged absences (for those purists among you) limit McClellan to spending no more than 50 command points for the entire scenario.",
